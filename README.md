# DevOps Dashboard 🧠📊

A real-time developer dashboard for visualizing GitHub project health, commit history, and CI/CD status.

---

## 🚀 Why This Project?

In modern software development, maintaining visibility into the health of your repositories, code commits, and deployment process is essential. However, developers often rely on multiple disconnected tools to monitor and track their projects.  
This dashboard centralizes everything in one place — cleanly visualized and updated in real time.

> **Goal:** Provide a single interface to observe GitHub repository activity, pipeline status, container health, and more.
